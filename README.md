## Background
With the increasing number of road accidents, Drive Guardian aims to enhance driver safety by providing a tool that automatically applies brakes when necessary. Our application leverages advanced machine learning algorithms, such as YOLO and lane detection, to ensure precise brake timing, reducing the risk of accidents.
 
## Description of Project
Our project aims to enhance the safety of drivers and passengers alike by leveraging live feeds from dashcam videos and utilizing advanced algorithms for real-time analysis of applying brakes.

## Features
- Real-time Analysis: Our system provides sophisticated real-time analysis of road conditions, continuously monitoring for potential hazards.
- Object Detection and Prediction: Utilizing advanced algorithms, we detect objects and predict potential hazards, empowering drivers with proactive insights.
- Enhanced Video Clarity: Through seamless integration of upscaling techniques, we enhance the clarity and accuracy of the video feed for precise analysis.

### Input
User-provided dashcam video or stream with their device.

### Data Preprocessing
- Camera Calibration: Removes lens distortion using cv2.undistort() and calibration data.
- Lane Feature Enhancement:
    - Gradient Thresholding: Highlights edges using abs_sobel_thresh().
    - Color Thresholding: Selects lane-like pixels based on color with color_threshold().
    - Bird's-Eye View: Transforms image for easier lane detection via cv2.warpPerspective().
- YOLOv5 Input: Likely handled internally, involving resizing and normalization.

### Object and Lane Analysis Techniques
- Utilized advanced Computer Vision techniques, including YOLO and machine learning models.
- Developed an ML model to detect lane and object detection.
- Leveraged CV models from `Github` to achieve exceptional accuracy in sentiment classification.
- Utilized `YOLO` and Sobel algorithm (CV model) for vehicle detection and lane detection.


### Output
Detects vehicle and lanes to apply emergency brakes.
